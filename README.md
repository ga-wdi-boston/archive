#WDI LA Lesson Resources




***


######Hello and welcome WDI LA Instructors! This repo is our go to spot for finding and adding materials and resources for our lessons.

##How to ***find*** lessons
You have two options when it comes to finding lesson materials in this repo:

1. Browse through each week of WDI and take a look at the lessons based on their titles.
2. Open up the ```lesson_topics``` folder and browse through each lesson by their topic.

##How to ***add*** lessons
To add a lesson to this repo follow these steps:

1. Navigate to your lesson's topic folder, if it exists. If there is no appropriate topic folder for your lesson, please create a directory for it under the ```lesson_topics``` folder.
2. Once you're in the appropriate topic folder, navigate to the folder with your lesson's title. If there isn't a folder within your lesson's title, please create one.
3. Once inside of the correct lesson folder, please create a new directory, title it with your name, and then place all of that lessons material inside of your named folder.
4. That's it!
