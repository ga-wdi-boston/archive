#User-Centered Design (UCD)

###What is UCD?

User-Centered Design is an approach to product design/development that maintains a persistent focus on users throughout the planning, creation, and deployment of that product. 

###Why should we care?

- *My users are the reason I'm making this product.* Repeat this daily. It's your new mantra. If you forget about your users, whose problem are you solving?

- User acquisition/retention is hard enough when your product is well-designed. If you aren't thinking about your users' needs, you aren't thinking about how to keep them engaged with your product.

(Driving with the parking brake on)

- Thinking carefully about your users and their needs takes a great deal of guesswork out of design (and makes planning easier!).

###Design patterns (and pitfalls) 

(This list goes from low user focus to high user focus.)

- **Non-design / Unintentional Design** Building a product without paying attention to design, users, or use cases. Any design that happens is incidental.
	- *Pros:* No user-focused time/effort required during planning and development.
	- *Cons:* Very risky; chance of landing on a usable/optimal design is low. Likely to require modifications after release/negative user feedback.

A famous example of this is twitter.  Twitter was originally intended as an SMS site to communicate with a small group. However, it’s most famous uses now extend to globally networked connections, real-time comments through to organising revolutions. Twitter has even ended up turning the hashtag, which was originally an accidental affordance, into a major part of its business model.

Even if you don’t use Twitter, you probably still touch an accidental affordance every day. Levi’s (and pretty much any other company that makes jeans) have always put a fifth pocket nested inside the right front pocket of their pants. This pocket was originally intended as a place to put a pocket watch, but as Levi’s itself pointed out in one of its most famous ads, it’s almost never used for a watch:

- **Solving Your Own Problems / Self-Design** Designing a product with yourself/your team in mind. (You're your own target user.)
	- *Ex*  A couple of folks mentioned this for their app (Will, Calle, Eric, Michael, Rocky, Ask question of who's app solved their problem), 37 Signals, in house bug tracking systems
	- *Pros:* Completely viable for internal tools. (google example, building a GA queue app)
	- *Cons:* Not everyone works the way you do/has the same problems you have. You're limiting your audience to people just like you, and likely missing out on a larger user base.
- **Experience-Based / "Genius" Design** Constructing a product using design lessons learned from past experience and/or the guidance of a designer.

	- *Pros:* Experienced designers have acquired knowledge from past product cycles that may prove useful to your current product. Some design best practices are patterns, and can be repeated for many scenarios.
	- *Cons:* Feedback is critical to good design, and not supplying your designer with input about your current product means that they may miss something special. Most great designers approach their work scientifically, constantly seeking feedback and testing hypotheses.
- **Function-Driven / Activity-Focused Design** Crafting use cases and designing for them, but limiting design focus to activities and actions.

	-cameras, chairs, keyboards, garden tools, kitchen utensils, automobiles, etc.

	- *Pros:* Workflow focus is important, and paying attention to user actions means that it's likely that decisions will be made with ease of use in mind.
	- *Cons:* This can be difficult to do when actions are new/different from familiar tasks or the team cannot relate to activity contexts.

- **User-Centered Design** Designing with the user at the center -- paying attention to app activities, action contexts, and user goals/motivations. 
- These teams look in-depth at the goals, needs, and contexts of the users, using that information to drive decisions into depths the team can't reach otherwise. 

- Using these techniques, a team working on the photo sharing site might discover that people often peruse photos of people they don't know, because they respect their photographic skills or subject decisions. This could lead to insights into developing new functions that let people track photographers they admire or look for examples of people using certain types of camera equipment.

- Maybe Michael using his app for other farmer's markets
- Maybe Callie's site for security, not only sharing iteniery
- Areg's site for user analytics


	- *Pros:* Most likely to lead to a product that users will engage with; user observation can help designers identify hidden needs and patterns of behavior that would not be discoverable under another design approach.
	- *Cons:* Time-consuming; requires research and knowledge of user (or target user).
	
###The ISO Standard

The International Organization for Standardization- the organization promotes worldwide proprietary, industrial and commercial standards.

We know that User Experience Design is a huge field -- GA even has an immersive program for it!  -- so we don't expect you to be able to do **full** User Centered Design during your WDI dev cycles. These principles are great to keep in mind:

ISO's *Human-centred design for interactive systems (ISO 9241-210, 2010).*

- The design is based upon an explicit understanding of users, tasks and environments.
- Users are involved throughout design and development.
- The design is driven and refined by user-centered evaluation.
- The process is iterative.
- The design addresses the whole user experience.
- The design team includes multidisciplinary skills and perspectives.
