#Sample Scenarios

Here is a sample set of scenarios corresponding to personas generated for Jen' and Meredith's fake app, *Catbook* (a social network for cats).

There are many ways to draft scenarios; feel free to research alternative formats. 

- Minerva is concerned that her cats spend too much time alone, but is also nervous about letting them go outside. She often leaves the television on while she's at work so Wilbur and Lionel can feel like a human is home. She rushes home every day after work to spend as much time with her cats as possible.
- Wilbur has recently been exploring technology with more interest. He is capable of tapping and swiping on a tablet, and has learned how to walk across a laptop keyboard. He is not able to do pinch gestures or any gestures that involve multiple finger touchpoints. He dislikes smartphones, because the screens are too small. Wilbur enjoys hearing alert sounds when things happen on apps.
- Minerva likes to post cat photos to her personal Facebook and Instagram accounts. Some friends and family members have recently started to unfollow her or mute her posts, and have left snide comments about the number of cat photos. Minerva has a few friends from school who are also cat owners, and she frequently "likes" or "favs" their cat photo posts.
- Gregor isn't allowed inside anymore, so he spends his time outdoors. He recently got into an altercation with a strange cat, and lost a portion of his tail. Gregor meows at other cats in the neighborhood to warn them about mean feral cats, but wishes he had a more effective system.
- Wilbur is very protective of Lionel, and wants to make sure that he is not growing up too fast. Wilbur often changes the channel when television shows are inappropriate for Lionel, and encourages the kitten to read Highlights Magazine or pursue other activities rather than waste time online. Wilbur always supervises Lionel when he uses the iPad or laptop.
- Minerva just got a credit card for the first time, and she loves earning airline miles through purchases. She has saved her credit card information on many sites, and enjoys the convenience of one-click purchases and subscriptions. She is very comfortable shopping online, as long as she trusts that a website or app will not steal her card information.
