###4. Talking Points/Road Map
1. **Intro and Discuss Goals and Classroom Culture** - Talk to the class about why it's valuable for us to do this exercise etc. - *5 minutes*
2. **Goals** - First the instructor discusses goals with class. Then have each student stand up and shout out some of their own WDI goals to the whole class. - *10 minutes*
3. **Team** - Have the students participate in an individual writing exercise, where they 1.) write about a time when they had an effective/successful team dynamic/process  and ***why***, and 2.) write about a time where they had an unsuccessful team dynamic/process, ***why*** it was unsuccessful, and ***how*** they resolved it or what would they have done differently. - *5 minutes*
4. **Culture Pair Share** - Next, students get into pairs and share their team experiences and start discussing with one another ***what*** cultural ideas/keywords helped make these team processes & dynamics effective, and what culture existed to enable these successful team experiences. - *10 minutes*
5. **White Boarding** - With an instructor whiteboarding each word, have the students shout out and share their keywords, ideas, and desires for their classroom culture.
