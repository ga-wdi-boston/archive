###Kitchen example
1
One change to kitchen you would make for yourself
3 Shares

2
One change to kitchen that would make the kitchen more popular
3 Shares

3
One change to kitchen for the person who maintains the kitchen
3 Shares

###Intro to topic
User-centered design
Typical programmer demo:    

1.  Look, it doesn't crash    
2.  There are four ways to do that (shows all four)

Typical things you know about our users:    

1.  They love you (i.e., your Mom)
2.  They really want to see your app and how every part of it works (i.e. that instructor you like)
3.  They have time to check it all out (i.e. that bored person in the lobby your awed to take a look)
4.  They have a deep interest in exploring any and every new site (i.e. Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny)
4.  They love you (your Mom)

Typical reasons it works how it does:  

1.  The authors of rails made rails g scaffold do it that way
2.  It matches your data model wireframe
3.  Facebook does it that way
4.  I don't know

##Objective  
1.  You understand UCD and can repeat enough of the idea back to get the interviewer to move on
2.  Sound like a genius to people who never heard of UCD at Meetups or sound like a seasoned pro to those who have
3.  Get strangers who look at your app to want to use it some more
4.  Have your users not hate you
5.  Maybe have users really like to use your app
6.  Complete the UCD elements for Project 3 as described in the Lab (below)

###Connection from models and use cases to test cases & test-driven development

Different types of people use sites

Don't need to argue on behalf of one user type

###Formal info    
Present class material with comments

###Explain: Create personas

###Explain: Generate Use cases from the personas

###Lab
Students create personas and use cases for their project  

At least 3 personas  
At least 2 use cases per person  
Share with class: personas and possible impacts on design.  
###Teach: 

How and where this connects and works in the development process
How it connects to testing in TDD
