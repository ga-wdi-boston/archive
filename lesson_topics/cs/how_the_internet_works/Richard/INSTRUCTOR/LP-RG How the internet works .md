###ASSESSMENT
Show of hands: 
Do you understand what happens when you click a webpage?  
What is the difference between the internet and the web (aka world-wide-
web)?  
Do you know the definitions of "front-end", "back-end", "transport-layer"?###CONNECTION TO THE BIG GOAL	Enable participation in the community of developers by being familiar with the most common terms.Know what part of the chain is broken when “it’s not working”.
Be ready to connect to web servers, database servers, and API's.

Understand where the different technologies that you are learning are located.###CLASS	 INTROObjective:  “By the end of this module, you will know how to program a Cisco border-gateway-protocol router using both least-cost and performance-tuned objectives, how to install an Apache server and custom-configure it, how to set up subnets and vlans inside companies – just kidding!”	###CONCEPT OF PARTIAL UNDERSTANDING
INSTRUCTOR 5 minAir-fuel ratio example – have them google.###MADLIBS:
GROUP:  20 min  
Pass out papers.  One person is scribe and reads clues or another person can read clues.  Do NOT read text until everyone is done.###SHARE MADLIBS
GROUP: 10 min  
Share a few rmad lib results, reading to group – maybe 1 to 3 for each paragraph###Internet History 
INSTRUCTOR: 20 min

INSTRUCTOR / GROUP 10 minPresent slidesReview Chain of Data (see slide 3)If you can’t reach a website, what is broken?  Ask what errors you might see for each.Browser  
Local DNS cache  
TCP/IP  
Network card either Ethernet or WIFI  
Router  
DNS Lookup  
More routersBig routers and backbones, “the information superhighway”  
More routersServer  
Webserver	

For router and TCP/IP discussion, try this at a terminal window:

traceroute cnn.com
ping cnn.com

Latency vs bandwidth####FIX THE MADLIB WITH REAL ANSWERS
GROUP: 15 minRemember from instructor or google.Put name on paper and turn in.####ASSESSMENT
